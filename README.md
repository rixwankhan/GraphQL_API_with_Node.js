# GraphQL API with Node.js Tutorial
Building a GraphQL API with Node.js

Node.js has emerged as a popular choice for building web applications, and with the advent of GraphQL, it has become even more powerful. GraphQL is a query language for APIs that provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible approach to data retrieval. In this article, we will explore how to build a Node.js GraphQL API with code examples.

What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language that allows clients to specify the data they need and receive exactly that. It was developed by Facebook and has become increasingly popular in recent years. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible approach to data retrieval than traditional REST APIs. With GraphQL, clients can specify the data they need using a single request, eliminating the need for multiple API calls.

Getting Started

Before we dive into the code, let’s make sure we have everything we need. To build a Node.js GraphQL API, we will need the following:

Node.js (version 10 or higher)
NPM or Yarn
GraphQL
Express
Apollo Server
Once we have all the necessary tools, we can start building our GraphQL API.

Creating a GraphQL Server with Node.js

To create a GraphQL server with Node.js, we will be using the Apollo Server library. Apollo Server is a library that makes it easy to build GraphQL servers in Node.js. To get started, let’s create a new project directory and install the required dependencies:

```
mkdir node-graphql-api
cd node-graphql-api
npm init -y
npm install graphql express apollo-server-express
```
